**Requirements:**

 1. Creating a public endpoint accessible worldwide without authentication or authorization -  **API Gateway** 
    
 2. Registering a domain name and mapping it to the API Gateway endpoint, ensuring that the URL remains the same even after redeployment.- **Route 53**
    
 3. Receiving events over HTTP encrypted via TLS 1.2. - **API Gateway**
    
 4. For ingesting up to 500 events per second at peak times. - **Kinesis Data Stream**
   
 5. Cross-region replication for ingesting events even when one AWS region goes down. **Kinesis Data Stream**
    
 6. Multi-region deployment for efficient ingestion and distribution of events from North America and Western Europe regions. - **API Gateway and Kinesis Data Stream**
    
 7. For monitoring and maintaining the SLA of 99.99% for the ingestion. - **Amazon CloudWatch**
   
 8. Monitoring and maintaining the SLA of 98% for consumption by internal systems. - **Amazon CloudWatch**

 9. For maintaining the durability of events to avoid complete loss of events when internal errors occur. - **Kinesis Data Stream**
   
 10. Cost-effective solutions can be achieved by utilizing **AWS Lambda** for event processing, **Amazon S3** for event storage, and choosing appropriate instance types for **ECS Fargate**.
    
 11. **Kinesis Data Stream** as the data source, and both ECS Fargate and Lambda as event consumers located in the same region as the Kinesis stream for faster processing.
    
 12. For storing the events for 30 days retention, ensuring that they can potentially be reread by the consumers in case of bugs during processing. - **Amazon S3**
